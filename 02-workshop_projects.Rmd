# Working Directory

If you tell R/R Studio to look for a file, or save a plot, it will (by default) look in a place called the working
directory (wd)   

 <img class="center" src="img/session02/working-directory.PNG"/>  

 You can (usually) see your working directory path at the top of the console panel...  

 ... it often defaults to the "Documents" folder.   

 This example is ~/workshop-r/ and ~ is in Documents  

---

# Browsing in RStudio

If you click the arrow next to the file pathway ~/workshop-r/  

 <img src="img/session02/working-directory.PNG"/>  

it will return you to the working directory and you can see all the files in that folder:  

 <img class="center" src="img/session02/wd-files.PNG"/>

# Organisation  

 <img class="center"src="img/session02/cognitive-load.PNG" width="15%"/>  

 Sooner or later (but probably sooner) you will wish to change where files are saved (and loaded from).   

 Being organised is key:  

 Reduces cognitive load (and frustration).

# RStudio Projects

make it *far easier* for you to:   

1) .blue[*Organise*] files and workflow   
2) .blue[*Switch*] between projects   
3) .blue[*Share*] scripts / projects with others   


.green[(when collaborating or getting assistance)] 

Recommended for all tasks (large or small).

---

# Create a project

File `r icons::fontawesome("arrow-right")` New Project `r icons::fontawesome("arrow-right")` New Directory `r icons::fontawesome("arrow-right")` New Project

Name the directory "workshop-r"  
Create as a subdirectory somewhere useful for you  
Create project!  

---

# RStudio Projects

Now your working directory is your project directory:

<img class="center" src="img/session02/workshop-r-project.PNG"/>  

R will save and load files from here (by default).  
If starting another project, repeat this process.
